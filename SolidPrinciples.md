# Solid Principles

The SOLID principles are composed of five simple but essential principles intended to make Software Design easily maintainable and scalable.

1. **S** - Single Responsibility Principle
2. **O** - Open/Closed Principle
3. **L** - Liskov's Substitution Principle
4. **I** - Interface Segregation Principle
5. **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle

# Single Responsibility Principle
Single Responsibility Principle states that **A class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job**. In other words, every class should have only one responsibility


# Open/Closed Principle
# Liskov's Substitution Principle
# Interface Segregation Principle
# Dependency Inversion Principle
