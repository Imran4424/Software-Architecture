# Solid Principles

The SOLID principles are composed of five simple but essential principles intended to make Software Design easily maintainable and scalable.

1. **S** - Single Responsibility Principle
2. **O** - Open/Closed Principle
3. **L** - Liskov's Substitution Principle
4. **I** - Interface Segregation Principle
5. **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle

# Single Responsibility Principle
Single Responsibility Principle states that **A software component should one and only one responsibility**. Based on the used programming paradigm this component can be a function or a class or a module.

Since we will be using Swift Object Oriented Paradigm, in our case a swift class will be a software component. But if we follow Protocol Oriented Programming in Swift then every protocol will be a software component. 

So in our case, every class should have only one responsibility.

If we look at the above pictures
- on the left we have Swiss Army knife
- on the right we have normal kitchen knife

Although swiss army knife is very useful in day to day life, it violates Single responsibility principle. On the other hand, the kitchen knife only have one responsibility, which is to cut some items.
